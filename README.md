DOM Manipulation project 

Hover your mouse over the grid to draw using your cursor.

Change the resolution of the grid using the button at the top. This increases the number of squares in the grid.

This project was built to practice using CSS grid, event listeners, and DOM manipulation using vanilla JS.
